---

* 50g unsalted butter 
* 50ml sunflower oil
* 2 lemons zest
* 150g caster sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 50g ground almonds
* 150g plain flour
* 2 tbsp cornflour
* 2½ tsp baking powder
* 90ml lemon juice
* 75g icing sugar

1. Line a small, 17cm-long loaf tin, or similar, with nonstick baking paper, and preheat the oven to 160°C fan.

1. Melt the butter in a pan, then pour into a mixing bowl along with the oil.

1. Add the lemon zest, sugar and eggs, whisk for a minute until smooth and slightly bubbly, then stir in the almonds.

1. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, cornflour and baking powder, then sift half of this into the butter/egg bowl. Beat in 75ml of the lemon juice, then sift in the remaining flour mixture and beat until smooth.

1. Bake for 45-50 minutes and leave to cool for five minutes.

1. Beat the remaining 15ml of lemon juice with the icing sugar, and spread this mix over the top of the cake while it's still in the tin. Leave until barely warm before serving.
